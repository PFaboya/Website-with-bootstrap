# Building a website with bootstrap

## summary

The aim of this project was to use the bootstrap coding found online to build a website with three pages. The website was required to have a nav bar, to be responsive to large and small screen widths and as much as possible use the bootstrap classes.

## The website

I went with an advertising website of a game I use to play a lot so I used the Jumbotron bootstrap feature to really enlarge the pictures that will ensure they are noticeable:

```html
<div class="jumbotron main-banner hidden-sm hidden-xs">
</div>
```
with the main jumbotron they are hidden when the screen size becomes small enough. CSS was used to set up an image to go on the jumbotron.

 Each page was arranged into rows and columns to ensure the features of each page were well structured and responsive when the screen width is changed.
